# GUST handoff — 2026-09-08

Ownership released. The repository is ready for a local AI to resume manually.

Latest pass (GitHub Copilot, VS Code agent, "GUST Builder" profile), committed to
`main` with fmt, strict Clippy, full workspace tests (107), full `verify.ps1 -Full`,
and an independent read-only review (PASS WITH NOTES, notes applied) — see STATUS:
- T06 complete (D17): the wgpu runtime refuses a pipeline unless the native Slang
  reflection helper `gust-slang-reflect` proves the descriptor's StorageV1 contract
  (names, slots, access, workgroup size, every nested offset/size/alignment/stride)
  against the same linked program whose WGSL it then executes. New tool
  requirement: build the helper once with `pwsh -File scripts/build-slang-reflect.ps1`
  (needs the Slang SDK from `VULKAN_SDK`/`SLANG_SDK` and MSVC); `verify.ps1` does
  this automatically. A missing helper is an explicit `HelperUnavailable` error.
- Agent customizations under `.github/` (GUST Builder and GUST Verifier agents, a
  `gust-status` prompt) and a PostToolUse `cargo fmt` hook (`.github/hooks`,
  `scripts/hooks`). They are operating profiles on top of AGENTS.md, not new rules.
Next: nothing claimed. The owner pre-authorized the ordered compiler extensions
T09 bounded loops → T10 atomics → T11 std-prelude lowering (NEXT_TASKS). Claim T09
in STATUS, write the contract (ARCHITECTURE + D18) and the failing tests first.

## Previous handoff — 2026-09-07

Earlier passes (GitHub Copilot, VS Code agent), each committed and pushed to
`origin/main` with fmt, strict Clippy, full workspace tests, smoke examples, and an
independent read-only review (PASS) — see STATUS for evidence:
- `Option<T>` lowers to Slang `Optional<T>` (D14): `Some`/`None`/`is_some`/`is_none`/
  `unwrap_or`/`if let Some(x)`; Option stays out of struct fields and buffers.
  Reviewed golden `tests/fixtures/option.slang` and a real-GPU test.
- T07 staged graph (D15): `gpu_dialect_wgpu::StagedGraph` with checked host-declared
  edges, ordered uploads, transfer/residency report; `examples/staged-graph`;
  `BufferBinding::independent_length()`.
- T08 component pool (D16): `GpuPool<T>` with GPU→GPU growth copies, retirement,
  count buffer; `create_indirect_buffer` and `StagedGraph::dispatch_indirect`;
  `examples/component-pool`. Contract in ENGINE_NORTH_STAR. `verify.ps1` now expects
  seven examples and twelve SPIR-V exports. 99 workspace tests. Full
  `verify.ps1 -Full` passed.
Next: nothing claimed. Candidates: T06 slice 2 (layout evidence), the std-prelude
type-name allowlist, a growth benchmark, or the culling → indirect-args proof.

Earlier in the same day: the quality patch below was independently reviewed (PASS),
`verify.ps1 -Full` passed after `3fd0aac` (four stale kernel-marker exports were
regenerated), and the T03 type-name frontier was closed: casts limited to 32-bit
scalar targets, non-32-bit Rust primitives rejected in every type position, `const`
blocks rejected by name.

Note on git state: the "pending signed commit at `d99d176`" wording below is
historical. The owner committed that work as `3fd0aac` ("T06 Continued", unsigned)
and pushed it to `origin/main` before this pass started.

Earlier quality review: Codex fixed struct RHS self-aliasing/shadowing, rejected
dropped record-update fields, and fixed current Slang diagnostic mapping. Baseline
74 tests became 82 passing tests; fmt, strict Clippy, and both smoke examples pass.
Worker allowance failures prevented independent review of the final quality patch
at the time; that review has since been completed (PASS). See STATUS.
T06 slice 1 is implemented and independently reviewed: 74 workspace tests,
formatting, strict Clippy, vector-add, and typed-pipeline verified on 2026-09-07.
The signed commit is pending the owner's existing signing public-key path; edits
remain uncommitted at baseline HEAD `d99d176`. See STATUS for scope and evidence.
No local model endpoint was configured and no account reset was used. T06 slice 1
uses delegated Codex Builder/Verifier review under AGENTS; no local AI service was
contacted. Read AGENTS, STATUS, NEXT_TASKS, then DECISIONS before claiming work.

## What changed and why

1. Re-anchored README and docs around GUST while retaining the working GPU Dialect
   crate APIs. The vision, compiler evolution, execution graph/CPU domains,
   portability tiers, and ECS destination are clearly separate from implemented code.
   Added decisions, ranked roadmap, agent agreement, and durable status/tasks.
2. Reproduced and fixed implicit helper-return loss, Rust numeric-suffix emission,
   binary precedence mismatch, and boolean versus integer `!`. Added typed local
   declarations. The typed-pipeline helpers now use ordinary Rust tail returns.
3. Replaced unproven positional shader struct construction with an explicit error.
   Whole-struct buffer copies and field updates remain supported. Added early
   diagnostics for kernel contracts, duplicate/zero workgroups, dropped attributes,
   malformed builtin receivers, resource-shadowing, generic structs, and ref patterns.
4. Corrected cache identity to include entrypoint. A GPU test alternates two
   entrypoints sharing one compilation unit and verifies outputs 11/22 plus two
   cache misses and two hits.
5. Hardened the compiler bridge with exclusive temp-directory creation and owned
   cleanup on all return paths (best effort if deletion is OS-blocked), both diagnostic
   streams, and SPIR-V structure checks. Tests cover collisions, compiler failure,
   early I/O failure, and malformed binary output.
6. Added reviewed full Slang golden, shared shader/GPU semantics fixture, four
   compile-fail documentation tests, and `scripts/verify.ps1`. The script stops on
   errors and emits `.ai/VALIDATION.json`; a deliberate missing-tool check was tested.
7. Hardened `scripts/verify.ps1` `Invoke-Checked` to capture **stderr** as well as
   stdout (redirected to temp files) and record both in `VALIDATION.json` (`stdout`
   plus a new `stderr` field). Previously a failing command's diagnostic — which
   cargo/clippy emit on stderr — was missing from the JSON record, leaving only the
   generic `"... failed (exit N)"` message. Exit-code/throw behavior and the
   stop-on-first-failure / always-write-record contract are unchanged.
8. Completed T05 (P1): `TargetProbe` capability records with failing-first
   WGSL/SPIR-V tests, and kernel-level Slang→Rust diagnostic mapping — `emit_kernel`
   writes a `// @rust kernel: {module}::{kernel}` marker per kernel, and on `slangc`
   failure the bridge appends the nearest marker's kernel to the `CompilationFailed`
   diagnostic. Line-level mapping is not possible on stable Rust (`proc_macro`
   spans do not expose line numbers).
9. Completed the T03 second slice (P0): broader name resolution and effect analysis.
   `visit_expr_path` rejects multi-segment bare path values (associated constants /
   foreign items such as `f32::INFINITY`, `u32::MAX`, `core::f32::consts::PI`) that
   the translator would otherwise emit as invalid Slang; `core` added to
   `BANNED_NAMES`; `visit_expr_try` rejects the `?` operator; `visit_expr_unsafe`
   rejects `unsafe` blocks. `asm!` needs no new rule (syn 2.0 parses it as
   `Expr::Macro`, already rejected). Two failing-first regression tests added.

## Important files

- Frontend: `crates/gpu-dialect-macros/src/{slang,validate,expand,regression_tests}.rs`.
- Bridge/contract: `crates/gpu-dialect/src/{slang,descriptor,abi,lib}.rs`.
- Cache/tests: `crates/gpu-dialect-wgpu/src/lib.rs`, `tests/semantics.rs` under that crate.
- Shared expectations: `tests/fixtures/semantics.{rs,slang}` and `numeric.{rs,slang}`.
- Validation: `scripts/verify.ps1`, `.ai/VALIDATION.json`.
- Documentation: README, AGENTS, `docs/`, and `.ai/`.
- Derived output: all 8 kernels in `generated-wgpu/` regenerated via the 5 examples;
  shader grouping and typed-pipeline source changed. Some binary/WGSL outputs remain
  byte-identical because Slang optimizes equivalent expressions.
- `.ai/CHANGED_FILES.md` inventories added/modified files against `BASELINE.sha256`.
  The owner then initialized Git (2026-09-07); `main` carries 9 commits through the
  skill-tracking work, and a Kilo worktree
  (`.kilo/worktrees/enchanted-farmhouse`) sits on the same commit.

## Verification evidence

Baseline before edits: 34 passing tests. Final: **57 passing tests**, zero failed
or ignored, formatting check and strict Clippy clean. All five runnable programs
passed on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 (native Vulkan wgpu). All eight exported SPIR-V
modules passed external Vulkan 1.2 validation. WGSL is the execution route; SPIR-V
validation is separate. The generated `.rs` files are readable host snippets, not
independently compiled standalone packages.

Tool versions: Rust 1.98.0; Slang 2026.13.1-1-g84792eb15;
SPIRV-Tools v2026.3.rc1-0-gb707790a. Final local evidence is timestamped in
VALIDATION.json (successful command records, 8 validated artifact hashes). Each check
record now carries `stdout` and `stderr` so a failing command's diagnostic is
preserved in the record. Debug example timings are smoke evidence, not a CPU/GPU
performance conclusion. Browser WebGPU, DXIL, Metal, other vendors, and the
manifest's older Rust minimum are unverified.

The stderr-capture patch was then **verified end-to-end** on 2026-09-07 under
**PowerShell 7.6.5** (`pwsh`; not Windows PowerShell 5.1): a full `-Full` run passed
(`VALIDATION.json` `passed: true`, 19 checks exit 0). `slangc -version` now lands in
`stderr` (record line 33); `cargo clippy`/`cargo test` runner lines are captured in
`stderr` (lines 59, 69); the `µs` timings render correctly (UTF-8 fix confirmed — no
more `┬╡`). **Environment note for future runs: use `pwsh` (PowerShell 7), not 5.1.**

T05 (both slices) was then verified on 2026-09-07: `cargo test -p gpu-dialect --lib`
12 passed (incl. both diagnostic-mapping tests), `cargo test -p gpu-dialect-macros`
20 passed (marker goldens), `cargo test -p gpu-dialect-wgpu --test semantics` 2 passed
on RTX 5090, and a full `cargo test --workspace` re-run after the slice 2 commit:
**66 passed, 0 failed** (62 unit/integration incl. 5 example binaries on RTX 5090,
+ 4 compile-fail doc tests). A full `verify.ps1 -Full` (fmt/clippy/examples/SPIR-V)
re-run after the slice 2 commit was not completed; the last full pass in
VALIDATION.json (2026-09-07 13:54 UTC) predates the slice 2 commit.

## Deferred and known risks

- The owner authorized T06 slice 1 on 2026-09-07. The new explicit reflection API
  reads Slang JSON and cross-checks nested POD fields. Runtime metadata remains
  macro-assigned, not reflection-derived. JSON from the tested compiler omits
  aggregate size, alignment, and buffer stride; successful cross-check reports are
  partial evidence, not complete ABI certification. No broader ABI was introduced.
- No rustc semantic integration, execution-graph compiler, ECS/renderer, dynamic
  pool growth, indirect execution, CPU fallback, or custom shader instruction IR.
- Explicit local types help but do not provide full Rust inference. Effect/evaluation
  order, aliases, and complete identifier hygiene remain open. Shader struct literals
  and resource-valued helpers fail explicitly until their lowering is proven.
  Slang→Rust source maps are kernel-level only: `slangc` diagnostics now name the
  originating Rust kernel, but line-level mapping needs non-stable spans.
- Concurrent first cache misses can compile twice; this is not a single-flight cache.
- Graph/engine APIs (T07/T08) remain planned, not completed.

## Recommended pickup

T04 (numeric semantics + struct construction) is complete: the `numeric` fixture
locks the emitted Slang, a real-GPU test proves signed/unsigned div/mod, float→int
casts, and struct field identity + source order, integer div/rem by a literal zero is
diagnosed at the Rust boundary, and struct literals lower to construct-then-assign.
See the T04 evidence block in NEXT_TASKS.md and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

**T05 (P1) is complete** — slice 1 is capability probe records (`TargetProbe` +
`probe` in `crates/gpu-dialect/src/slang.rs`, failing-first WGSL/SPIR-V tests);
slice 2 is kernel-level diagnostic source mapping (`// @rust kernel:` markers,
nearest-marker lookup appended to `CompilationFailed`).

**T03 (P0) is complete (both slices)** — slice 1 is fail-closed signature/attribute/
builtin diagnostics; slice 2 (this pass) is broader name resolution and effect
analysis: `visit_expr_path` rejects multi-segment bare path values (associated
constants / foreign items), `core` is banned, `visit_expr_try` rejects `?`, and
`visit_expr_unsafe` rejects `unsafe` blocks. Failing-first tests in
`regression_tests.rs`. With T03, T04, and T05 done, the P0 and P1 rows are complete
except T06, whose first slice is now authorized. See STATUS for the slice 1
implementation and verification record. The next reflection step needs actual
compiler aggregate size/alignment/stride evidence before runtime enforcement.
Do not bundle a wider ABI or an ECS framework (T08) into this slice.
Remaining bounded frontier: cast target types and `const` blocks
are still accepted by the validator and only fail at Slang compile time.

Start from the workspace root:

```powershell
.\scripts\verify.ps1 -Full
cargo test -p gpu-dialect-macros regression_tests
cargo test -p gpu-dialect-wgpu --test semantics
```

Do not blindly regenerate golden expectations. Review emitted Slang and actual GPU
results; retain the independent host expectations. Record task/file ownership in
STATUS and exact verification results before the next handoff.

## Allowance policy

The owner asked Codex to reserve the final portion of either allowance window for
stabilization and handoff near 10% remaining. Reliable starting readings were 88%
five-hour and 29% weekly. No reset credit was used. The final account snapshot is
added below; it is historical and does not constrain a future local AI's runtime.

Final handoff checkpoint: **12% five-hour / 17% weekly remaining**. New implementation
stopped at this natural milestone near the requested 10% reserve; only inventory,
documentation checks, and the final response followed. No reset credit consumed.
