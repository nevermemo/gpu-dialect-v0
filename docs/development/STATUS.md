# Current status

## Active: roadmap M3 (2026-10-24)

The roadmap agreed with the owner is in [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md). M0 closed on
2026-10-23 after a two-reviewer sanity check (D28): every M0 item is done except M0.15,
which waits for a week of green CI (from 2026-10-30). M1 (diagnostics) closed on
2026-10-23 (D33): M1.0 to M1.6 are done (per-item evidence in the roadmap), after a
sanity check by Fable and Opus (both "proceed with fixes") and the full validation
below. M2 (typed host API) closed on 2026-10-24 (D37) after a sanity check by Fable and
Codex (both "proceed with fixes") and `check-full` at `634a50e`. M3 (dual test builds): plan
adopted 2026-10-24; D38 narrows D22's integer guarantee to a defined domain (the owner
confirmed it in D39: edge-case differences are documented limitations, not to be matched);
spike S1 passed (decision A); m3.a1 (ledger), m3.a2 (contract text) and m3.b (`gust::cpu`)
done; m3.c next.

- M3 m3.b (`a7dcb95`): `gust::cpu`, the CPU backend the macro twin will use (m3.c, planned).
  It is `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` with no new dependencies, and the erased-binding downcast is
  confined to `read`/`write`. Public items: `CpuDevice`, `CpuBuffer<T>`, `CpuBinding`,
  `CpuJob`, a non-exhaustive `Error`, and `ulps`. The `#[doc(hidden)]` macro support is
  `validate`, `read`, `write`, `invocations` and `FromGlobalId`. `validate` follows
  gust-wgpu's check order (aliasing last) and returns `DeviceLimit` above 2^32 invocations.
  Overflow mode: `overflow_checks()` reports `gust`'s own build, and `overflow_checks!()`
  reports the calling crate's (plan Revision 5; the cross-crate proof is due in m3.f1). The
  `dispatch.rs` tests run on `gust::cpu` instead of a mock. Evidence: fmt, clippy, `gust` lib
  and doctests (debug and release), check-feature core, check-arch, Unit suite, check-fast,
  docs-check, rustdoc `-D warnings`; 8 mutations killed.
- M3 m3.a2 (`cc88b1a`, docs only): `docs/SEMANTICS.md` is the executable-semantics
  contract. It states the scope, the labels (spec-allowed, measured, proven; nothing is
  proven yet), the defined domain with D22's narrowing (D38, D39), WGSL float rules quoted by
  section (15.7.2 to 15.7.6), a per-operation bound table with input domains, reassociation
  as a limitation, and the tolerance method. Worked polynomial bound: 46u, asserted at 48u in
  m3.c. Also covered: memory preconditions (a sequential twin hides races), the atomics rule
  (the weak compare-exchange may fail spuriously, so the atomics test is narrower than the
  spec; m3.d revisits it), and the ledger as limitations. The review corrected the plan's
  float bounds (correctly rounded allows either neighbour; 2.5 ULP is up to 5u). No test
  exercises float rounding yet, and none covers `f32 as u32` in range. Evidence: docs-check,
  lint, ledger test green.
- M3 m3.a1 (`96ec90b`): known-mismatch ledger. `tests/fixtures/mismatch.rs` (13 kernels,
  blessed golden) and `crates/gust-wgpu/tests/mismatch.rs` pin, per row, the GPU outcome and
  the plain-Rust outcome; the Rust column follows the run-time `overflow-checks` mode (debug
  run: checked; `--release` run: wrapping). GPU values that WGSL defines are enforced: division
  and remainder by zero, `MIN / -1`, shift-amount masking, wrapping, and finite out-of-range
  float-to-int casts (WGSL 15.7.6: 2147483520, 4294967040, `-1e20 -> i32::MIN`). NaN,
  infinities, subnormals (flushed on the RTX 5090), `NaN != NaN` (false on the GPU) and
  out-of-bounds access are recorded as unspecified one-adapter observations, not enforced
  (D39). `docs/SEMANTICS.md` lists them as limitations; an id guard keeps doc and test in step;
  `verify --mode full` adds a `--release` ledger pass. Spike S2 record: 33 in-domain controls
  agree; six cast outcomes differed from the body's pre-registration and are listed. Evidence:
  fmt, clippy, ledger debug and release, docs-check, lint, Unit suite, check-fast green.
- M3 spike S1 (pre-registered, decision A): a minimal `gust::cpu` (module-level
  `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, the erased-binding downcast confined to `gust::cpu::read`
  and `write`) plus a macro-emitted `#[cfg(any(test, gust_dual))] impl Run<K, N> for
  gust::cpu::CpuDevice` runs vector-add's shadow body on the CPU. The twin equals the host
  reference and the GPU exactly at counts 1, 63, 64, 65 and 257 (RTX 5090); no kill rule
  fired, no manifest changed, clippy and check-fast green. The spike stays on a local branch
  (`dc2ad87`, not merged); m3.b and m3.c rebuild it with tests.
- M2 sanity-check fixes (`2d1880b`, D37): indirect launches check everything except the
  workgroup count on both the validation and the execution path, so `with_limits` with a
  lower `max_compute_workgroups_per_dimension` no longer rejects them through a placeholder
  count (new graph test fails before the fix; three mutations caught); the `DeviceLimit`
  doc says `validate` checks every node before any compile; a kernel with a
  `Uniform<T>`/`ConstantBuffer<T>` parameter has no generated typed call and is rejected
  by the runtime (`UnsupportedParameter`), now said in every doc that claimed "every
  kernel"; wgpu zeroes over-limit indirect counts only under its default instance flags.
  Evidence: fmt, clippy, gust-wgpu tests, check-ui, docs-check, lint, Unit suite, check-fast
  green after two review rounds (Opus: keep after fixes).
- M2 close-out (code and user docs, `009f86a`): `gust_wgpu::DEFAULT_MAX_COMPUTE_WORKGROUPS_PER_DIMENSION`
  is pinned to `wgpu::Limits::default()` by a unit test and to the opened device by a GPU test, and replaces
  the examples' seven copies of 65 535. One runtime StorageV1 and size assertion now guards typed, pool and
  indirect-argument buffers (unit tests per clause, a GPU test per allocation path, mutations caught).
  `StagedGraph::dependency_indices` replaces the examples' copies. README, ARCHITECTURE, EXECUTION_GRAPH and
  VALIDATION describe the M2 code; decisions D34 (typed call surface, alias contract), D35 (derived edges)
  and D36 (launch limits and what stays unchecked). Evidence: fmt, clippy, gust-wgpu tests, docs-check, lint,
  Unit suite and check-fast green after the review fix round (Opus: keep after fixes); `check-full`
  passed at `634a50e` (2026-10-24T05:44:34Z, RTX 5090).
- M2 m2.f2: particle-step and typed-pipeline batch typed calls; staged-graph and
  component-pool build every frame with `StagedGraph::write/run/run_indirect/read`, so all
  edges are derived, and they assert the derived sets (`[[], [0], [0, 1], [2]]` and
  `[[], [0], [0, 1], [1]]`; the pool readback depends on `prepare`, the last writer of
  `active`). Rejection tests keep the explicit API. Release runs of all four pass on the
  RTX 5090; swapping `calibration` and `readings` in typed-pipeline is E0271 (`2a4f3f6`).
- M2 m2.f1: vector-add, atomic-counter, polynomial and signal-pipeline dispatch through the
  generated typed calls (`<kernel>::dispatch`, `BufferDispatch::from(&call)` batches,
  `Independent(&buffer)`); host references, tolerances and export code are unchanged, and
  the release runs of polynomial and signal-pipeline pass on the RTX 5090. The one-shot
  "GPU end-to-end" figure in polynomial and signal-pipeline now waits twice (dispatch, then
  readback) instead of once; no before/after number was measured. Release workgroup counts
  are pinned by unit tests against a copied 65 535 (a shared constant follows in the M2
  close-out) (`ef52d86`).
- M2 m2.g: a hand-written `KernelDescriptor` whose Slang uses an undeclared identifier
  fails in slangc with the error on its marked Rust line, through `slang::compile`, both
  reflect paths and the native reflection helper (`#line`, not the table lookup); with an
  empty line table the Slang line is reported and no Rust source. The fixture never
  passes through `#[gpu]`, so later validator work cannot remove it (M1 risk 5, D33).
  Known difference: without `// @rust kernel:` markers, `slang::compile` names no kernel,
  while `reflect` and the helper add `originating Rust kernel` (`c6571d5`).
- M2 m2.e: `StagedGraph` derives dependencies from typed calls. `write`, `run`,
  `run_indirect` and `read` record the latest earlier writer of every buffer a node
  touches (RAW, WAW) and, for a writing node, every reader since that writer (WAR); the
  set is conservative and still validated, and execution stays in insertion order. Mixed
  graphs work. Measured (spike S4): staged-graph and component-pool derive exactly the
  pre-registered sets, with GPU readbacks equal to the declared graphs. `validate` now
  checks device limits for every node before anything compiles (closing the m2.b gap)
  and rejects an indirect node whose arguments buffer is also bound read-write (measured:
  a wgpu usage-conflict panic). Indirect counts are known only on the GPU: wgpu zeroes
  over-limit counts silently and checks the real device limits, so a limit lowered with
  `with_limits` does not apply to them. `GraphReport` counts derived and declared edges and
  is `#[non_exhaustive]` (`229bfbf`).
- M2 m2.d2: const layout assertions. Every `#[gpu]` struct asserts, in one const block,
  each field at its padding-free offset (the message names the field), no tail padding,
  alignment 4 and `LAYOUT.is_storage_v1()`; every kernel asserts per storage parameter
  that the element layout is StorageV1 and matches its Rust size, alignment and stride.
  `cargo check` now reports what only the runtime asserts caught. The plan's premise that
  no accepted struct could fail was false: a `#[gpu]` struct with a hand-written outside
  `GpuPod` field of alignment 8 passes the validator; it is now E0080 at compile time
  (fixtures `layout-outside-field`, `layout-outside-element`). check-ui follows a primary
  span's macro expansion to the outermost site inside the case (const-eval panics point
  into core). Open for m2.f2: pool buffers (`gust-wgpu/src/pool.rs`) skip the runtime
  layout assert that `create_typed_buffer` has (`adeb7be`).
- M2 m2.d1: `#[gpu]` generates `call`, `submit` and `dispatch` on every kernel handle:
  one argument per storage parameter in declaration order, element and device pinned by
  `Resource` bounds (each spanned on its parameter), access from the parameter. A
  per-kernel const assert pins the storage count against `DESCRIPTOR`, so `cargo check`
  catches a mismatch. Kernels with a `Uniform` parameter get no typed call; kernels with
  no storage parameters take the device type (`call::<D>(..)`). Measured: component-pool's
  five-parameter kernel infers without turbofish (spike S3); a wrong element type is
  E0271 on the user's line; a device without `Run` shows `Run`'s `on_unimplemented` text.
  A non-GUST argument gives two E0277 errors, so it has no fixture. Known limits: the
  `__Gust` prefix of generated generics is not reserved; the `Into` and `Run` notes still
  point at `#[gust::gpu]` (`a83a96e`).
- M2 m2.d0: `check-ui` reads `cargo check --message-format json` and judges only the
  case's own diagnostics; a failing case must produce exactly one error. `expected.txt`
  pins it by keys: `code`, `file` and `line` (exact, on one primary span), `message`
  (substring of the message or a child note) and `label` (substring of that span's label,
  where `on_unimplemented`'s label lands, measured on real runs). Editing the label text in
  `gust` now fails check-ui. Open for m2.d1: spans inside macro-generated code may need
  `expansion` followed, and one error per case may be tight for two-error fixtures
  (`a8b074f`).
- M2 m2.c: `gust-wgpu` implements the typed surface. `HeadlessDevice` is a
  `TypedDevice` with a `Run<K, N>` for every kernel, and `GpuBuffer<T>` is a `Resource`;
  every typed call goes through the existing persistent-binding validation (layout,
  device, access, current length) before any wgpu object. One buffer bound to two
  parameters is now rejected as `Error::AliasedBinding` when either binding is
  read-write, on typed, untyped and graph paths (measured before: read-only plus
  read-write panicked in wgpu, read-write twice ran with the last writer winning; no
  example binds a buffer twice, and check-examples passes). Binding indices are checked
  against `max_bindings_per_bind_group` on every dispatch path. 19 GPU tests in
  `tests/typed.rs`. The `_` arm on the `#[non_exhaustive]` `LengthRule` binds any
  rule this crate does not know with the strictest one (`Shared`), by design (decided at
  M2 close, D37); the indirect-arguments alias is checked since m2.e (`119ece3`).
- M2 m2.a: typed call surface in `gust` (`dispatch.rs`). `TypedDevice` extends
  `Device` (unchanged) with a `Binding<'r>` type; `Resource`, `Arg`, `Independent`,
  `LengthRule` and `Call` describe one typed launch, and `Run<K, N>` submits it.
  `Call::new` takes the descriptor from the kernel type and asserts the binding count
  at monomorphisation; order, access, element and device are checked by generated
  calls (types) and by each backend at submit (contract). Only test mocks implement it
  so far (a recording mock and a CPU-shaped `RefCell` mock); `gust-wgpu` follows in
  m2.c, the macro in m2.d1 (`3060072`).
- M2 m2.b: launch-limit checks. Every dispatch path checks the kernel and its bindings
  against the opened device's limits before any compile or cache lookup and returns
  `Error::DeviceLimit`; before, wgpu panicked (measured: workgroup size 512 at pipeline
  creation, 65 536 workgroups at dispatch). The opened RTX 5090 device carries wgpu's
  default limits, not the adapter's. `HeadlessDevice::with_limits` only lowers limits
  (five fields at the time; six since m2.c added the binding index). Known gaps: the
  dispatch emitted by `render_wgpu_source` and buffers above `max_buffer_size` are not
  checked (D36); the multi-node graph gap of this slice was closed by m2.e, whose
  `validate` runs the limit pass for every node before any compile (`151ef56`).

- M1.6: sanity-check fixes. Clippy `disallowed-methods`/`disallowed-macros` replace the
  hand-written uncoded-error scanner, and the exception is confined to `diagnostics.rs`
  by a test; a code counts as tested only when an assertion passed for it; `#line`
  paths follow the macro's path rule, including Unicode letters (slangc echoes UTF-8
  names); `resolver = "3"` with unchanged lockfiles. Unit, Slangc and Reflect passed on
  the merged tree (`1f961fc`).

- M1.3: the compile-time copy carries `#line` directives on `slang::compile*` and both
  reflection paths; exported `.slang` never does. The native helper honours them, and
  the sidecar records `line_directives`. 10 of 10 deliberate failures land on the right
  Rust line on WGSL and SPIR-V; WGSL/SPIR-V bytes are identical with and without
  directives for three fixtures. Columns stay Slang columns; only the first error is
  attributed (`8fcf944`, `7007827`).
- M1.4: a rejected `#[gpu]` module is returned beside `compile_error!` with `#[kernel]`
  removed, kernel fns renamed and private as on the success path, and the prelude
  imported; `mod m;` gets the error alone. Measured on `vector-add` with one rejection
  inside the referenced kernel (rustc 1.98): one error before and after, the same
  message; the editor benefit is not measured (`e01b82c`, `f507ab4`).
- M1.5: every `#[gpu]` rejection carries a stable code (`[GUST-E0401] message`, D31);
  111 codes, one `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` section each with its reachability. Every code is
  asserted by a test or listed as unreachable through `#[gpu]` (seven codes). Guards:
  unique codes, doc and enum agree, and a source scan for uncoded `syn` errors whose
  limits the doc states (`df07122`, `6e195bc`, `f20d313`).
- M1 carry-overs: check-ui matches each expectation within one rustc diagnostic; the
  `on_unimplemented` text no longer claims exclusivity; the vcvars capture refuses
  inherited multi-line values that could forge a variable (`fb257c9`).
- Bug fix: the `typed-pipeline` and `staged-graph` release runs dispatched 65 536
  workgroups against wgpu's default limit of 65 535 and panicked; release sizes are now
  `1 << 21` with a test per example, and both release runs complete (`5c34e22`).

## Current baseline

- Branch: `main`
- Last complete compiler feature: T12, statement-only `match Result<T, T>`
- Last full validation: `cargo xtask check-full` passed from 2026-10-24T05:40:27Z to
  05:44:34Z on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 / Vulkan at `634a50e` (clean tree), through the
  shared cargo slot wrapper: workspace tests, release-mode slang tests, all 8 examples
  (debug builds), and 13 SPIR-V artifacts through `spirv-val`. Release-mode example runs
  are per-slice evidence (m2.f1, m2.f2 probe logs), not part of this record. The previous
  full run (M1) was at `a6cbb8f`, together with the Slangc and Reflect suites. The local `.ai/VALIDATION.json` record
  stamps the commit and dirty state and contains no machine paths.
- DX19 is closed: full validation, two independent reviews, and fixes (`027eef7`,
  `08a4843`, `3296885`).
- CI (`unit` job: fmt, clippy, Unit suite; `msrv` job on Rust 1.90) passes on main;
  one push on 2026-10-23 (`10b2e06`) was red and was fixed in `3cdc607`.

## Latest DX evidence

- 2026-10-23 Unit-tier CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, Rust pinned to 1.98.0): fmt,
  workspace clippy with warnings denied, `cargo test -p gust-macros` (54 passed) and
  `cargo test -p xtask` (6 passed) passed locally before the first push. Evidence tiers
  (Unit, Slangc, Spirv, Reflect, Gpu) are defined in `VALIDATION.md`. The DX tasks
  were renamed DX19/DX20 so decision ids continue at D21. History was rewritten to
  replace machine paths and the repository is now `nevermemo/gust`.
- 2026-10-23 approval and privacy policy: AGENTS.md gained an Approvals section
  (all actions pre-authorized by the owner) and a parallel-lane branch rule;
  `.ai/VALIDATION.json` is now untracked and xtask redacts the workspace root and home
  directory when writing it. `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo test -p xtask`
  (6 tests), `cargo clippy -p xtask -- -D warnings`, and `cargo xtask check-fast`
  passed through the shared cargo slot wrapper.
- 2026-10-23 cleanup: the stale T13-derived `generated-wgpu/pool__classify.*` exports
  were moved out of the tree, so `generated-wgpu/` again holds the 13 `.spv` files
  `check-full` expects. The T13 stash is untouched.
- 2026-10-22 documentation sync, no code changes: README, ARCHITECTURE,
  ENGINE_NORTH_STAR, NEXT_TASKS, HANDOFF, and the Copilot builder agent profile now
  record DX19 as committed with release evidence pending, point T13 at its stash, and
  list atomics (T10), Option/Result (D14), and bounded struct literals (D07) as
  supported. An independent read-only review checked each added claim against the
  validator, emitter, regressions, fixtures, GPU tests, and xtask (PASS);
  `git diff --check` passed.
- `cargo xtask check-feature core` passed (19 core tests), including sidecar-map
  schema/line-range coverage and construct-enriched compiler diagnostics.
- `cargo test -p xtask` passed (3 routing tests).
- `cargo xtask check-feature result` passed (6 macro plus 4 GPU/target tests).
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` and `git diff --check` passed.
- DX19 writes temporary `kernel.map.json` files with stable Slang line/construct
  segments and appends mapped kernel/construct labels to Slang failures. Focused
  `cargo test -p gust --lib slang` passed (14).
- Full validation was not refreshed after DX19 because T13 changes were then in the
  working tree. They are now stashed; the `generated-wgpu/` blocker above remains.
