# Current status

## Active: none claimed (2026-09-08)

The lean upstream generated-output cleanup is complete and ready for independent review
and commit. Next candidate: deeper internal splits inside `gpu-dialect-wgpu/src/lib.rs`
or macro `validate/`/`slang/`, but those are no longer pure file moves and should be
scoped carefully.

## Lean upstream generated-output cleanup — COMPLETE (2026-09-08)

Ownership released. Owner was GitHub Copilot (VS Code agent, "GUST Builder" profile).
Baseline: clean `main` at `2b9f042`; 48 tracked files under `generated-wgpu/`.
No compiler/runtime semantics changes intended.

What changed. Removed the tracked derived `.slang`, `.wgsl`, `.spv`, and readable host
`.rs` files under `generated-wgpu/`. Added ignore rules for `generated-wgpu/`, future
`artifacts/generated-wgpu/`, local `vendor/`, and local `.cargo/registry/` / `.cargo/git/`
download caches. Updated README, AGENTS, Builder profile, validation docs, repo
structure docs, and next-task notes to treat generated outputs as local reproducible
artifacts while keeping `.ai/VALIDATION.json` as verification evidence.

Validation: `cargo xtask check-artifacts` passed at 2026-09-08T10:53:39Z after the
tracked files were removed; example binaries regenerated ignored local artifacts in
`generated-wgpu/`, exported SPIR-V validation completed, and `GUST verification passed`
with exit 0. `cargo xtask check-changed` also passed with exit 0 after the doc and
ignore-rule updates.

Independent review: GUST Verifier PASS. The review confirmed 48 generated-wgpu
deletions, 0 tracked generated-wgpu files, correct ignore rules for generated outputs
and local crate caches, `.ai/VALIDATION.json` and `.ai/BASELINE.sha256` still tracked
and unmodified, and no stale checked-in-artifact wording in live docs.

Next command: commit and push this cleanup.

## Core crate cleanup — module directories — COMPLETE (2026-09-08)

Ownership released. Owner was GitHub Copilot (VS Code agent, "GUST Builder" profile).
Baseline: clean `main` at `333d170`; `cargo xtask check-feature core` passed before
edits. No behavior changes intended.

What changed. Moved core compiler-facing modules into same-name directories:
`reflect/mod.rs`, `slang/mod.rs`, and `spirv/mod.rs`. Public paths remain
`gpu_dialect::reflect`, `gpu_dialect::slang`, and `gpu_dialect::spirv` because the
module declarations in `lib.rs` are unchanged.

Validation: `cargo xtask check-feature core` passed (18). `cargo xtask check-feature
reflection` passed (9 core reflection tests + 4 wgpu reflection tests). No generated
artifact drift observed.

Next command: run `cargo xtask check-fast` or claim the next cleanup slice.

## Macro crate cleanup — module directories — COMPLETE (2026-09-08)

Ownership released. Owner was GitHub Copilot (VS Code agent, "GUST Builder" profile).
Baseline: clean `main` at `1c4c6d3`; `cargo xtask check-feature macro` passed before
edits. No behavior changes intended.

What changed. Moved `expand.rs`, `slang.rs`, and `validate.rs` into module directories:
`expand/mod.rs`, `slang/mod.rs`, and `validate/mod.rs`. The `mod expand; mod slang;
mod validate;` names in `lib.rs` are unchanged, so crate-internal references and public
proc-macro behavior stay the same.

Validation: `cargo xtask check-feature macro` passed after the move (31 tests + 0 doctests).

Next command: claim the next cleanup slice here.

## Macro crate cleanup — regression test layout — COMPLETE (2026-09-08)

Ownership released. Owner was GitHub Copilot (VS Code agent, "GUST Builder" profile).
Baseline: clean `main` at `b473f29`; `cargo xtask check-feature macro` passed before
edits. No validator/lowering behavior changes intended.

What changed. Moved `crates/gpu-dialect-macros/src/regression_tests.rs` to
`crates/gpu-dialect-macros/src/tests/regression.rs` and used `#[path =
"tests/regression.rs"] mod regression_tests;` so existing `regression_tests::...` test
names remain stable. Updated fixture `include_str!` paths for the deeper file.

Validation: first macro check caught the expected moved-path failures; after path
updates, `cargo xtask check-feature macro` passed (31 tests + 0 doctests).

Next command: claim the next cleanup slice here, or run `cargo xtask check-fast` before pausing.

## Wgpu runtime split — cache module — COMPLETE (2026-09-08)

Ownership released. Owner was GitHub Copilot (VS Code agent, "GUST Builder" profile).
Baseline: clean `main` at `c65e60c`; `cargo xtask check-feature gpu-smoke` passed
before edits. No behavior changes intended.

What changed. Moved `PipelineCacheStats`, `KernelCacheKey`, `CachedKernel`, and
`PipelineCache` from `crates/gpu-dialect-wgpu/src/lib.rs` into
`crates/gpu-dialect-wgpu/src/cache.rs`. Re-exported public `PipelineCacheStats` and
kept cache internals `pub(crate)` for the runtime module.

Validation: `cargo xtask check-feature gpu-smoke` passed (5, including cache-key tests).
`cargo xtask check-feature wgpu` passed all wgpu unit/integration tests (19 total).

Next command: claim the next runtime or macro module split here.

## Wgpu runtime split — generated host renderer — COMPLETE (2026-09-08)

Ownership released. Owner was GitHub Copilot (VS Code agent, "GUST Builder" profile).
Baseline: clean `main` at `8584bc2`; `cargo xtask check-feature gpu-smoke` passed
before edits. No behavior changes intended.

What changed. Moved `render_wgpu_source` and its private string-rendering helpers from
`crates/gpu-dialect-wgpu/src/lib.rs` into `crates/gpu-dialect-wgpu/src/generated_host.rs`.
Re-exported `render_wgpu_source` from `lib.rs` to keep the public path stable, and made
`validate_kernel` `pub(crate)` so the renderer continues to use the same descriptor
validation path.

Validation: `cargo xtask check-feature gpu-smoke` passed (5, including
`renders_descriptor_specific_wgpu_source`). `cargo xtask check-feature wgpu` passed all
wgpu unit/integration tests (19 total across lib + integration targets). No generated
artifact drift observed.

Next command: claim cache extraction here, then run `cargo xtask check-feature gpu-smoke`.

## Wgpu runtime split — Error module — COMPLETE (2026-09-08)

Ownership released. Owner was GitHub Copilot (VS Code agent, "GUST Builder" profile).
Baseline: clean `main` at `ccc3068`; `cargo xtask check-feature gpu-smoke` passed
before edits. No runtime behavior changes intended.

What changed. Moved `gpu_dialect_wgpu::Error` and its `Display`/`std::error::Error`
impls out of `crates/gpu-dialect-wgpu/src/lib.rs` into
`crates/gpu-dialect-wgpu/src/error.rs`, then re-exported it from `lib.rs` so the public
`gpu_dialect_wgpu::Error` path remains stable. Removed the stale `std::error` import
from `lib.rs`.

Validation: first smoke compile caught the old import collision; after removing it,
`cargo xtask check-feature gpu-smoke` passed (5). `cargo xtask check-feature wgpu`
passed all wgpu unit/integration tests (19 total across lib + integration targets).

Next command: claim generated-host or cache extraction here, then run `cargo xtask check-feature gpu-smoke`.

## Xtask modularization — COMPLETE (2026-09-08)

Ownership released. Owner was GitHub Copilot (VS Code agent, "GUST Builder" profile).
Baseline: clean `main` at `013edda`; `cargo xtask self-test` passed before edits. No
behavioral or command-surface changes intended.

What changed. Split the former 1300+ line `xtask/src/main.rs` into internal modules:
`checks.rs` (user-facing commands and routing), `verify.rs` (staged verification and
record policy), `reflect.rs` (native Slang reflection helper build), `process.rs`
(command execution/capture), `workspace.rs` (workspace constants and changed-file
discovery), `validation.rs` (VALIDATION.json, JSON escaping and SHA-256), and
`time.rs` (UTC timestamp formatting). `main.rs` is now a thin dispatcher.

Validation: `cargo xtask self-test` passed after the split; `cargo xtask check-format`
passed; `cargo xtask check-lints` passed; `cargo xtask status` reads the active status;
`cargo xtask check-feature loops` passed (1 macro golden/rejection group + 2 GPU loop
tests); `cargo xtask check-workspace` passed. No generated artifact drift observed.

Next command: claim the wgpu runtime file split here, then run `cargo xtask check-feature gpu-smoke`.

## Repository structure pass — operational docs and examples — COMPLETE (2026-09-08)

Ownership released. Owner was GitHub Copilot (VS Code agent, "GUST Builder" profile).
Baseline: clean `main` at `d8577cc`. No compiler/runtime semantics changes.

What changed. Human-readable operational markdown moved out of `.ai/` into
`docs/development/`: `STATUS.md`, `NEXT_TASKS.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, and
`CHANGED_FILES.md`. `.ai/VALIDATION.json` and `.ai/BASELINE.sha256` remain in `.ai/`
as machine-readable/generated state. Added durable development docs:
`docs/development/README.md`, `REPO_STRUCTURE.md`, `VALIDATION.md`, and
`AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`. Updated AGENTS, README, custom agents/prompts, docs links, and
`cargo xtask status` so future agents use `docs/development/*` paths.

All seven examples now have a thin `src/main.rs` entry point and a `src/app.rs`
implementation module, including `vector-add`. The app modules preserve the existing
GPU module, host/reference code, artifact export, and ignored example tests; this is a
low-risk first split that makes entry points uniform. Larger examples can later split
`app.rs` into `gpu.rs`, `cpu.rs`, `host.rs`, and `tests.rs` as described in
`docs/development/REPO_STRUCTURE.md`.

Verification (Rust 1.98.0, Slang 2026.13.1, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090/Vulkan): pre-move
`cargo xtask status` worked; after the move `cargo xtask status` reads
`docs/development/STATUS.md`; `cargo xtask check-workspace` passed; `cargo xtask
check-examples` passed all 27 ignored example tests and all seven example binaries;
`cargo xtask check-lints` passed after removing one unused `WORKGROUP` constant exposed
by the module split; `cargo xtask check-format` passed. `cargo xtask check-full`
passed and refreshed `.ai/VALIDATION.json` at 2026-09-08T10:15:53Z with mode `full`,
passed `true`, 32 checks, 12 validated SPIR-V artifacts, and 109 summed test passes.
No `generated-wgpu/` drift.

Next command: claim T10 here, then write the atomics contract before code.

## DX — xtask automation batch — COMPLETE (2026-09-08)

Ownership released. Owner was GitHub Copilot (VS Code agent, "GUST Builder" profile).
Baseline: clean `main` at `adaff36`. Implemented all requested DX efficiency items
except item 9 (`status --update`) and item 13 (`GUST_EXAMPLE_SIZE` example-size
overrides), as requested. No compiler/runtime semantics changes.

What changed. `cargo xtask verify` now supports `--record` / `--no-record`; only full
verification records by default, so routine `gpu`/`fast` checks do not dirty
`.ai/VALIDATION.json`. Added `check-workspace`, which runs workspace tests with all
example packages excluded. Added `check-changed`, `status`, `doctor`, `check-format`,
`check-lints`, `list-tests`, and `explain-check`. Added GPU subgroups: `gpu-smoke`,
`gpu-semantics`, and `gpu-runtime`. `measure-tests` now accepts `--json <path>` and
its default workspace timing uses the optimized non-example workspace path. README,
VS Code tasks, AGENTS, and the GUST Builder profile advertise the expanded command
surface. Shared `HeadlessDevice` fixtures remain deliberately unimplemented because
the evidence does not yet isolate adapter/device creation as the bottleneck;
cache-stat tests still need isolated devices.

Verification. `cargo xtask status`, `doctor`, and `explain-check gpu-semantics`
printed expected guidance. `cargo xtask list-tests` summarized 109 listed Rust tests
and 5 doctests. `cargo xtask measure-tests --json target/tmp/test-times.json cargo
test -p gpu-dialect-macros regression_tests::loops_golden` passed and wrote valid
JSON. `cargo xtask check-workspace` passed with example packages excluded. `cargo
xtask check-feature gpu-smoke` passed (5), `gpu-runtime` passed (4), and
`gpu-semantics` passed (10). `cargo xtask verify --mode gpu` left
`.ai/VALIDATION.json` byte-identical; `cargo xtask verify --mode gpu --record` wrote a
valid GPU-mode record. `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace
--all-targets -- -D warnings`, and `cargo xtask check-workspace` passed. `cargo xtask
check-full` passed and refreshed `.ai/VALIDATION.json` at 2026-09-08T09:46:39Z with
mode `full`, passed `true`, 32 checks, 12 validated SPIR-V artifacts, and 109 summed
test passes in the captured log (ignored count 0 because example tests are run
explicitly after the optimized non-example workspace stage).

Skipped by request: no `cargo xtask status --update` command and no example-size
environment overrides.

Next command: claim T10 here, then write the atomics contract before code.

## DX — cross-platform `xtask` command surface — COMPLETE (2026-09-08)

Ownership released. Owner was GitHub Copilot (VS Code agent, "GUST Builder" profile).
Baseline: clean `main` at `d3e4588`. No compiler/runtime semantics changes.

What changed. Added workspace crate `xtask` plus `.cargo/config.toml` alias so the
primary command surface is `cargo xtask ...` on Windows, Linux, and macOS. The xtask
binary replaces the deleted PowerShell scripts with: `build-slang-reflect` (MSVC via
`cl` or `vcvars64.bat` on Windows, `c++`/`CXX` with rpath on Unix), `verify --mode
smoke|fast|gpu|examples|artifacts|full`, `check-feature`, `check-fast`,
`check-examples`, `check-artifacts`, `check-full`, `export-artifacts`,
`measure-tests`, `hook-format-rust-after-edit`, and `self-test`. The native helper
reuse remains timestamp-gated and still runs `--version`; full verification still
rewrites `.ai/VALIDATION.json`, runs workspace tests, ignored example tests, all seven
example binaries, and validates twelve exported SPIR-V artifacts. Hooks and VS Code
tasks now call `cargo xtask`, and README/AGENTS/GUST Builder docs point to the cargo
commands. `scripts/probes/layout.slang` and `scripts/probes/slang-layout.cpp` remain
as source fixtures.

Verification (Windows host; cross-platform code paths for Linux/macOS are compiled but
not executed here): `cargo xtask self-test` passed; `cargo xtask check-feature loops`
passed (1 macro loop test + 2 GPU loop tests); `cargo xtask hook-format-rust-after-edit`
accepted read/edit JSON smoke inputs and exited 0; `cargo fmt --all -- --check` exit
0; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` exit 0; `cargo xtask
check-fast` passed; `cargo xtask verify --mode gpu` passed; `cargo xtask check-full`
passed and refreshed `.ai/VALIDATION.json` at 2026-09-08T09:23:47Z with mode `full`,
passed `true`, 32 recorded checks, and 12 validated SPIR-V artifacts. One artifact
hash was cross-checked against Python `hashlib` and matched. `cargo xtask measure-tests`
passed; current timings: macro ~0.38s, core lib ~0.96s, wgpu ~9.55s, workspace
~13.59s. No `generated-wgpu/` drift. `Cargo.lock` changed only to add the local
dependency-free `xtask` package.

Known uncertainty: Unix helper compilation (`c++` + rpath) is implemented but not run
on this Windows session. The hook command uses a tiny dependency-free JSON heuristic
for PostToolUse input; it is intentionally conservative and formats only when the
event text contains an edit tool and a `.rs` path.

Next command: claim T10 here, then write the atomics contract before code.

## DX — command surface and staged verification — COMPLETE (2026-09-08)

Ownership released. Owner was GitHub Copilot (VS Code agent, "GUST Builder" profile).
Baseline: clean `main` at `c1fae21` (DX test split pushed). No compiler/runtime
semantics, dependency, or generated artifact changes.

What changed. Added named scripts: `scripts/check-fast.ps1`, `check-full.ps1`,
`check-feature.ps1`, `check-examples.ps1`, `check-artifacts.ps1`,
`export-artifacts.ps1`, and `measure-tests.ps1`. `scripts/verify.ps1` now supports
staged modes `Smoke`, `Fast`, `Gpu`, `Examples`, `Artifacts`, and `Full`; the legacy
`-Full` switch remains valid. `scripts/build-slang-reflect.ps1` skips relinking the
native helper when the executable is newer than its source/library/DLL inputs, while
still running `--version`. Added VS Code tasks in `.vscode/tasks.json` for fast,
feature, examples, artifacts, and full checks. README now has a validation matrix,
and the GUST Builder agent points future agents at the staged commands. Kept the
shared-device idea evidence-gated: use `measure-tests.ps1` before introducing shared
`HeadlessDevice` fixtures because cache-stat tests need isolated devices.

Superseded on 2026-09-08 by the cross-platform `cargo xtask` command surface above;
new work should not use these deleted PowerShell scripts.

Verification. `pwsh -File scripts/check-feature.ps1 -Area loops`: 1 macro loop test
and 2 GPU loop tests passed. `pwsh -File scripts/check-fast.ps1`: helper reported
"up to date", fmt passed, macro/core/wgpu tests passed, validation record mode
`fast`. `pwsh -File scripts/test-verify-process.ps1`: PASS after updating the harness
for the refactored `verify.ps1` function contract. `pwsh -File scripts/verify.ps1
-Mode Gpu`: passed wgpu tests. `pwsh -File scripts/verify.ps1 -Mode Examples`: all
27 ignored example tests plus seven example binaries passed. All PowerShell scripts
parse cleanly. `pwsh -File scripts/check-full.ps1`: **GUST verification passed**;
`.ai/VALIDATION.json` refreshed at 2026-09-08T09:13Z with mode `full`, 33 checks, 12
validated SPIR-V artifacts. No `generated-wgpu/` drift. `measure-tests.ps1` default
timings on this machine: macro tests ~0.4s, core lib ~0.9s, wgpu ~9.6s, workspace
~12.9s.

Known note. A deliberately malformed Bash-quoted PowerShell parser command failed
while testing; the corrected single-quoted parser command passed all scripts. A
Bash invocation of `measure-tests.ps1 -Command 'a','b'` passed a comma-joined string;
the default and ordinary PowerShell usage work.

Next command: claim T10 here, then write the atomics contract before code.

## DX — test-speed split — COMPLETE (2026-09-08)

Ownership released. Owner was GitHub Copilot (VS Code agent, "GUST Builder" profile).
Baseline: clean `main` at `0d98e73` (T09 pushed). No compiler/runtime semantics,
dependency, generated artifact, or example binary behavior changes.

What changed. Example crate tests are no longer part of the normal development test
loop: every `#[test]` in the seven example crates is marked
`#[ignore = "example validation runs only in full verification"]`. The tests are not
deleted; `scripts/verify.ps1 -Full` now runs `cargo test -p <example> -- --ignored`
for every example before running each example binary and validating exported SPIR-V.
Regular per-feature target compile smoke tests now compile WGSL only:
`semantics_compile_to_wgsl`, `numeric_compiles_to_wgsl`, `option_compiles_to_wgsl`,
`struct_assignment_compiles_to_wgsl`, and `loops_compile_to_wgsl`. Redundant
example-side SPIR-V structure / `spirv-val` tests were removed; centralized full
verification still validates all twelve exported `.spv` artifacts.

Files: `crates/gpu-dialect-wgpu/tests/{semantics,numeric,option,struct_assignment,loops}.rs`,
all seven `examples/*/src/main.rs`, `scripts/verify.ps1`, README, `.ai/` records.

Verification (Rust 1.98.0, Slang 2026.13.1-1-g84792eb15, SPIRV-Tools v2026.3,
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 / Vulkan, pwsh 7.6.5): focused touched wgpu tests
`cargo test -p gpu-dialect-wgpu --test semantics --test numeric --test option --test
struct_assignment --test loops` **10 passed**. `cargo test --workspace` now reports
**82 passed, 27 ignored** (ignored = example tests) plus 5 doctests, instead of
running the example validation tests every time. `cargo test -p vector-add --
--ignored` **3 passed**, proving ignored example tests remain executable. `cargo fmt
--all -- --check` exit 0; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
exit 0. `pwsh -File scripts/verify.ps1 -Full` **GUST verification passed**;
`.ai/VALIDATION.json` refreshed at 2026-09-08T08:56Z with 33 checks, 12 exported
SPIR-V artifacts, and the captured full log shows **109 passed, 27 ignored** (the 109
includes the 27 ignored example tests run explicitly by package). No `generated-wgpu/`
drift.

Purpose. The routine loop is now faster and more purposeful: feature changes should
start with the exact owning test, then the normal workspace suite; example proofs,
example binaries, and exported SPIR-V validation are reserved for major changes and
release readiness.

Next command: claim T10 here, then write the atomics contract before code.

## T09 — bounded `for` loops in the dialect — COMPLETE (2026-09-08)

Ownership released. Owner was GitHub Copilot (VS Code agent, "GUST Builder" profile)
under the owner's pre-authorization. Baseline `main` at `b4ce8e3` (107 workspace
tests after T06). Decision D18.

What changed. The dialect now accepts the bounded form `for i in start..end { .. }`
and rejects the unbounded/unproven loop forms. The end bound is evaluated once into a
reserved `__gust_end_N` temporary before the loop, matching Rust `Range` construction;
the loop variable is an immutable fresh binding, and `_` becomes a reserved
`__gust_iter_N` counter. Statement-position unlabeled, valueless `break` and
`continue` emit directly; `return` inside a loop continues to lower through the
existing return expression path. The macro validates the syntactic shape plus the
known literal-inference hazard (unsuffixed integer literal bounds are rejected so
Slang cannot infer `int` where rustc inferred `u32`); rustc shadows and Slang still
own non-literal type checking in this proc-macro architecture.

Rejected with single-cause diagnostics: `while`, `loop`, `..=`, open ranges,
non-range iterables, tuple/`mut`/`ref` patterns, labels, `break` with a value,
`break`/`continue` outside a loop, `break`/`continue` used as values, expression-
position ranges, unsuffixed literal bounds, and loop variables shadowing resources or
the dispatch ID.

Files: `crates/gpu-dialect-macros/src/validate.rs` (`is_unsuffixed_integer_literal`,
`loop_variable`, `range_bounds`, loop-depth tracking, jump checks, range rejection),
`crates/gpu-dialect-macros/src/slang.rs` (`emit_for`, statement-position jump arms),
`crates/gpu-dialect-macros/src/regression_tests.rs`, new
`tests/fixtures/loops.{rs,slang}`, new `crates/gpu-dialect-wgpu/tests/loops.rs`,
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md` D18, README and GUST Builder guardrails,
`.ai/` records. No runtime, ABI, dependency, example, or generated-wgpu export changes.

Tests. `loops_golden` locks end-bound hoisting, `_` counter naming, nested loops,
`break`, `continue`, `return`, signed and unsigned loops. Rejection tests cover 17
unsupported forms above. The GPU test uses an independent host reference with closed
forms where possible and runs at 1/63/64/65/257 on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090/Vulkan:
initial trip count is preserved while the loop body shrinks the bound; the window loop
takes the `break` path; nested loops produce nonzero outputs; signed helper loops
skip zero via `continue`; both WGSL and SPIR-V compile.

Verification (Rust 1.98.0, Slang 2026.13.1-1-g84792eb15, SPIRV-Tools v2026.3,
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 / Vulkan, pwsh 7.6.5): focused `cargo test -p
gpu-dialect-macros` **31 passed**; `cargo test -p gpu-dialect-wgpu --test loops`
**2 passed**; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` exit 0;
`pwsh -File scripts/verify.ps1 -Full` **GUST verification passed**, 26 checks, seven
examples, all twelve existing exported SPIR-V artifacts validated, no `generated-wgpu/`
drift, `.ai/VALIDATION.json` refreshed at 2026-09-07T23:35Z. After independent review,
doc wording was tightened to avoid overclaiming validator-side type knowledge and the
reviewed loop golden was compiled to `target/tmp/t09-loops.spv` and validated with
`spirv-val --target-env vulkan1.2` exit 0; focused macro loop tests and GPU loop tests
still pass.

Independent read-only review (GUST Verifier): **PASS WITH NOTES**. Notes: (1) direct
validator proof covers syntax plus unsuffixed-literal hazards, while non-literal range
types are checked by rustc shadows/Slang; docs updated accordingly. (2) loop-specific
external `spirv-val` was not run by the reviewer; Builder ran it afterward as recorded
above. Tree unchanged during review.

Open follow-ups (not claimed): run a deliberate test-pruning/developer-experience pass
before continuing deep into T10/T11; consider a rustc-type integration story if the
dialect wants the macro validator itself to prove all non-literal range operand types.

Next command: claim T10 here, then write the atomic semantics contract before any code.

## T06 — compiler-authoritative StorageV1 layouts (native Slang reflection) — COMPLETE (2026-09-08)

Ownership released. Owner was GitHub Copilot (VS Code agent, "GUST Builder" profile)
under the owner's pre-authorization. Baseline `main` at `59081b2`. Decision D17.

What changed. Slang 2026.13.1's `slangc -reflection-json` omits aggregate size,
alignment, and buffer stride, so the CLI path could never certify the ABI. The runtime
now uses a native helper, `gust-slang-reflect` (`scripts/probes/slang-layout.cpp`,
built by `scripts/build-slang-reflect.ps1` against the Slang SDK in `VULKAN_SDK` or
`SLANG_SDK`). The helper links one entry point for one target through the Slang API,
writes the artifact, and walks the *same linked program's* type layouts into a
schema-1 JSON record (compiler build tag, target, entry, source and artifact FNV-1a
fingerprints, workgroup size, per-resource slot/space/access/element stride, and the
recursive element layout with size/alignment/stride/scalar kind/fields). Anything
outside StorageV1 — vectors, arrays, non-32-bit scalars, counters, entry-point
resources, uniforms, binding arrays — makes it exit 1 with a message rather than emit
a partial record.

Core (`crates/gpu-dialect/src/reflect.rs`): `compile_reflected`,
`compile_reflected_with_helper`, `native_compiler_path` (`GUST_SLANG_REFLECT`, then
`target/slang-reflect/`, then PATH), `CompiledReflection::from_output` (schema and
identity checks, fingerprints re-derived in Rust, UTF-8 for WGSL, structural SPIR-V
decode, empty artifact rejected), `Reflection::read_json(.., complete)` requiring
every layout field in complete mode, `Reflection::cross_check_kernel` (no duplicate
names/slots on either side, one compiler resource per storage parameter and none left
over, equal group/binding/access, recursive field identity/offset/size/alignment/stride),
new `Error::{HelperUnavailable, Incomplete}`. `slang::decode_spirv` is `pub(crate)`.

Runtime (`crates/gpu-dialect-wgpu/src/lib.rs`): private
`HeadlessDevice::compile_kernel` (via `cached_kernel`) runs `compile_reflected` +
`cross_check_kernel` before any wgpu object is created, uses the helper's WGSL as the
shader source, and returns `Error::Reflection` on any failure; cache counters change
only on success. Bindings are still macro-assigned; the runtime verifies, it does not
derive (AGENTS invariant reworded accordingly).

Tooling/docs: `scripts/verify.ps1` builds and version-checks the helper before the
cargo steps (missing SDK/toolchain is a failure, not a skip). README requirements and
runtime section, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` "Struct ABI", `docs/DECISIONS.md` D17,
`docs/ROADMAP.md` S2, `AGENTS.md` invariant.

Tests (failing-first where the gate did not exist): core
`crates/gpu-dialect/tests/reflection.rs` 5→9 — native compilation complete for both
targets with exact `Outer` layout (size 12, align 4, stride 12) and full-ABI reports;
missing helper → `HelperUnavailable` naming `GUST_SLANG_REFLECT`; padded `float3`
fixture → `Compiler(CompilationFailed)` from the helper on both targets (pinned to the
variant after review); outer size alone does not certify nested sizes on the CLI path.
GPU `crates/gpu-dialect-wgpu/tests/reflection.rs` (new, 4) — workgroup mismatch fails
before dispatch with cache (0,0,0) and buffer untouched; renamed resource, wrong
binding, wrong access, wrong element type, and extra compiler resource each fail with
the exact expected message; a cached pipeline does not authorize a changed descriptor
(cache (1,1,1) afterwards); nested-struct + scalar kernel matches the host reference at
0/1/63/64/65/257 across two dispatches each with cache (1,1,9). Probe (deleted, not
committed): helper SPIR-V byte-identical to `compile_spirv`; WGSL identical after CRLF
normalization.

**107 passed, 0 failed, 0 ignored** (102 unit/integration + 5 doctests; baseline 99).
`pwsh -File scripts/verify.ps1 -Full`: **GUST verification passed**, 26 checks, seven
examples, all twelve SPIR-V exports validated, no `generated-wgpu/` drift;
`.ai/VALIDATION.json` refreshed (2026-09-07T22:50Z). Independent read-only review
(GUST Verifier): **PASS WITH NOTES**; it also confirmed the helper rejects entry-point
uniforms, global scalars, binding arrays, `AppendStructuredBuffer`, `half`, array and
`bool` fields with hard exits, and that `GUST_SLANG_REFLECT=/nonexistent` makes all
four GPU tests fail loudly. Three low notes fixed in place (wrong symbol name in two
docs, cache-key wording, test pinned to the compiler variant).

Open follow-ups (not claimed): the exported `generated-wgpu/*.rs` host snippets still
show `slang::compile_wgsl` without the reflection gate (template at wgpu `lib.rs`
~502; changing it regenerates twelve derived files); the "same compilation" property
rests on the helper linking one component — Rust fingerprints prove file↔JSON
consistency, not provenance; `Error::Incomplete` is defensive and unreachable from the
native path; the `KernelCacheKey` is pointer identity of `&'static` descriptor slices,
sound today but worth a content hash if descriptors ever become dynamic.

Next command: claim bounded loops here, then
`cargo test -p gpu-dialect-macros regression_tests` as the baseline before writing the
failing validator/emitter tests.

## Historical: T06 claim text (2026-09-08, superseded by the COMPLETE entry above)

Hypothesis at claim time: Slang's native type-layout API supplies the aggregate layout
metadata missing from CLI JSON. Check the existing native probe on WGSL and SPIR-V
first; then require complete compiler evidence for the current StorageV1 binding
contract, including negative mismatches and real GPU upload/readback. Do not infer
unknown layout values from Rust. Confirmed and delivered as recorded above.

## T08 — component pool and indirect workload proofs — COMPLETE (2026-09-07)

Ownership released. Owner was GitHub Copilot (VS Code agent) at the user's request.
Contract written first in `docs/ENGINE_NORTH_STAR.md` "Component pool contract (T08)"
and recorded as D16. Scope delivered: `GpuPool<T>` (capacity, host-tracked logical
length mirrored to a one-element count buffer, host-driven geometric growth by GPU→GPU
copy of the live prefix, retirement list drained by `pool_reclaim`, `GrowthRecord`
evidence, `pool_truncate`, `pool_read`), `create_indirect_buffer`, and
`StagedGraph::dispatch_indirect`. New `examples/component-pool`. Not in scope and not
done: freelists, compaction, entity IDs, atomics, culling/rendering.

Files: new `crates/gpu-dialect-wgpu/src/pool.rs`; `lib.rs` (`indirect` tag on
`GpuBuffer`/`BufferBinding`, `is_indirect_args_layout`, errors `IndirectArgsLayout`,
`IndirectBindingLength`, `PoolTruncateGrows`, module wiring); `graph.rs`
(`DispatchIndirect` node, args counted as a read for hazards, every binding must be
independent-length and non-empty, `GraphReport::indirect_dispatches`); new
`examples/component-pool/`; workspace `Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock`; `scripts/verify.ps1`
(seven examples, twelve exports); README; `docs/{ENGINE_NORTH_STAR,DECISIONS}.md`;
`.ai/` records; eight new `generated-wgpu/pool__*` exports. No dependency, dialect,
or signing changes.

Key evidence-driven design point: wgpu 30's indirect-validation shader silently zeroes
a dispatch whose workgroup count exceeds `max_compute_workgroups_per_dimension`
(`wgpu-core/src/indirect_validation/dispatch.rs`). The runtime therefore cannot bound
an indirect count; the contract requires the args kernel to clamp to the allocation
(`particles.len()`) and a budget, and the consuming kernel to guard on both the
GPU-derived active count and `.len()`. `prepare_dispatch` uses an overflow-free
ceiling division (`n / 64 + min(n % 64, 1)`), adopted from the independent review.

Verification (Rust 1.98.0, Slang 2026.13.1, SPIRV-Tools v2026.3, RTX 5090/Vulkan):
`cargo fmt --check` exit 0; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -D warnings` exit 0;
`cargo test --workspace` **99 passed, 0 failed, 0 ignored** (94 unit/integration +
5 doctests; baseline 94). `component-pool` tests: both targets compile and validate;
GPU-authored state survives growth 4→8 (geometric) →70 (required exceeds doubling)
with exact `GrowthRecord`s and copied bytes, then integrates 70 through the indirect
path (partial second workgroup) and `pool_reclaim` returns 2; budget clamp (100 of
130), truncate to 65 and to 0, `PoolTruncateGrows`, push after truncate reuses
capacity; growth while an `integrate` submission is in flight preserves its writes;
five rejection cases. `cargo run -p component-pool`: 4096→262144 particles over six
frames, 5160960 bytes copied GPU→GPU, 12 B upload and 4 B readback per frame, zero
retired allocations pending. `scripts/verify.ps1 -Full` under pwsh 7.6.5: **GUST
verification passed**, seven examples, all twelve SPIR-V exports validated;
`.ai/VALIDATION.json` refreshed. The post-review args edit was re-verified with
fmt/clippy/the five tests/the example, and the re-exported
`pool__prepare_dispatch.spv` passes `spirv-val` (the full-run record predates that
one-line change). Independent read-only review: **PASS** (growth ordering,
retirement, indirect safety, hazard check, tests); its overflow note is applied.

Next command: none claimed. Candidates in NEXT_TASKS: T06 slice 2 (authoritative
layout evidence via `scripts/probes/`), the std-prelude type-name allowlist (T03
follow-up), a growth benchmark separating allocate/copy/submit, or the third engine
proof (culling → compacted indirect args). Claim one here before editing.

## T07 — first explicit staged graph proof — COMPLETE (2026-09-07)

Ownership released. Owner was GitHub Copilot (VS Code agent) at the user's request.
Scope per NEXT_TASKS T07 and `docs/EXECUTION_GRAPH.md` "First bounded proof": CPU
settings upload → GPU stage A → GPU stage B → small summary readback, with explicit
host-declared dependencies, inspectable transfer byte counts, intermediate residency,
and rejection of invalid resources/dependencies. No inference, no reordering, no
transfer planner, no ECS (D15).

Files: new `crates/gpu-dialect-wgpu/src/graph.rs` (`StagedGraph`, `NodeId`,
`GraphReport`, `GraphOutput`, `HeadlessDevice::execute_graph`), `lib.rs`
(`BufferBinding::independent_length`, `IndependentLengthEmpty`, four `Graph*` error
variants, module wiring), new `examples/staged-graph/` (kernels `transform` and
`summarize`, host reference, four tests), workspace `Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock`,
`scripts/verify.ps1` (six examples, ten exports), README, `docs/{EXECUTION_GRAPH,
DECISIONS}.md`, `.ai/` records, and eight new `generated-wgpu/staged__*` exports.
No dependency or signing changes. Tests live in the example (no separate
`tests/graph.rs`), matching the other examples.

Runtime contract change, explicit and opt-in: `BufferBinding::independent_length()`
lets one binding's length differ from the dispatch element count when the kernel
guards that buffer with its own `.len()`; the default stays the strict shared-length
rule, and an empty independent buffer is rejected when the dispatch has work. Needed
because a one-element settings buffer and an N→N/8 reduction are impossible under
the equal-length rule.

Graph semantics: nodes execute in insertion order inside one command buffer.
`validate` runs before any GPU object is created: dependencies must be earlier nodes
(`GraphDependencyOrder`), every node passes the existing persistent-dispatch/buffer
checks, and every earlier node that conflicts on a buffer (either side writes) must
be a transitive ancestor (`GraphMissingDependency { node, producer }`). Uploads are
encoded staging→target copies so they order with the dispatches (not
`Queue::write_buffer`). `GraphReport` records per-transfer bytes, dispatch and
workgroup counts, and `resident_bytes` for buffers only dispatches touched.

Verification (Rust 1.98.0, Slang 2026.13.1, SPIRV-Tools v2026.3, RTX 5090/Vulkan):
`cargo fmt --check` exit 0; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -D warnings` exit 0;
`cargo test --workspace` **94 passed, 0 failed, 0 ignored** (89 unit/integration +
5 doctests; baseline 90). `staged-graph` tests: both targets compile and validate;
CPU parity for N ∈ {0,1,7,8,9,63,64,65,257,1000} × two settings with exact upload
(16 B), readback (N/8·16 B), resident (2·N·4 B), dispatch, workgroup, and transfer
assertions; ordering across two settings updates; eight rejection cases (undeclared
upload→A edge, undeclared A→B edge, foreign NodeId, read-only readback, wrong upload
length, wrong readback type, unknown readback node, strict length rule, empty
independent buffer). `cargo run -p staged-graph`: 262144 samples → 32768 summaries,
upload 16 B, readback 524288 B, resident 2097152 B, second update 2.6 ms host.
`scripts/verify.ps1 -Full` under pwsh 7.6.5: **GUST verification passed**, six
examples, all ten SPIR-V exports validated; `.ai/VALIDATION.json` refreshed.
Independent read-only review: **PASS**, no findings (hazard check, ordering, staging
lifetime, zero-length paths, `independent_length`, test soundness).

Next command: T08 (component pool / indirect workload proofs) per NEXT_TASKS; claim
it here before editing. Its prerequisite — a specified logical length/capacity/
retirement contract — must be written before code.

## `Option<T>` deterministic lowering to Slang `Optional<T>` — COMPLETE (2026-09-07)

Ownership released. Owner was GitHub Copilot (VS Code agent) at the user's request.
The owner chose to represent `Option<T>` in Slang instead of banning std-prelude type
names (D14; supersedes the allowlist suggestion in NEXT_TASKS T03). This is the
VISION "deterministic lowering" row for `Option`; `Result`, `match`, `?`, and payload
enums stay out of scope. `f64`/`u64`/8-bit primitives are NOT emulated: WGSL has no
such scalars and the storage ABI stays four-byte (D08/D09).

Files: `crates/gpu-dialect-macros/src/{validate,slang,regression_tests}.rs`, new
`tests/fixtures/option.{rs,slang}` (reviewed golden), new
`crates/gpu-dialect-wgpu/tests/option.rs`, `docs/{ARCHITECTURE,DECISIONS}.md`,
`.ai/` records. No runtime, ABI, dependency, or signing changes.

Evidence before editing (slangc 2026.13.1, WGSL + SPIR-V + `spirv-val`, all exit 0):
Slang `Optional<T>` supports `none`, implicit `T -> Optional<T>` returns, generic
`Optional<T> __gust_some<T>(T)` and `T __gust_unwrap_or<T>(Optional<T>, T)` helpers,
reassignment, `Optional<bool|int|uint|struct>`, `.hasValue` on call results, and a
`var __gust_opt_N = e; if (__gust_opt_N.hasValue) { var x = __gust_opt_N.value; ... }`
shape for `if let`. WGSL lowers it to a `{ value, hasValue }` struct.

Implemented (failing-first: `option_golden` and `option_unsafe_forms_are_rejected`
both failed against `f3ec044`): validator accepts `Option<T>` (T = supported scalar or
module struct) in locals and helper params/returns, `Some(x)`, `None`, `.is_some()`,
`.is_none()`, `.unwrap_or(d)`, `if let Some(x) = e { } else { }`; rejects Option in
struct fields and resource element types, nested/resource payloads, `.unwrap()`/
`.expect()`, non-`Some(ident)` patterns, let chains (11 rejection cases). Emitter maps
`Option`→`Optional`, emits the two generic helpers when any Option feature is used,
and lowers `if let` through a per-statement `__gust_opt_{index}` temporary (an
`else if let` gets its own scope).

Verification (Rust 1.98.0, Slang 2026.13.1, RTX 5090/Vulkan): `cargo fmt --check`
exit 0; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -D warnings` exit 0; `cargo test
--workspace` **90 passed, 0 failed, 0 ignored** (85 unit/integration + 5 doctests;
baseline 86). Existing goldens unchanged. GPU test compiles both targets and matches
an independent host `Option` reference at 1/63/64/65/257 elements across presence
tests, `unwrap_or`, `if let` on a local and on a call result, `Option<Pair>`, and
helpers returning/accepting Options. `vector-add` and `typed-pipeline` exit 0; no
derived-artifact drift. Independent read-only review: **PASS**, no findings; its
hand-traced reference values for x = 0, 3, 7, 8, 1001 match.

Next command: T07 (first explicit staged graph proof) per NEXT_TASKS and
`docs/EXECUTION_GRAPH.md` "First bounded proof"; claim it here before editing.

## Validator frontier — cast targets, primitive types, const blocks (2026-09-07)

Ownership released. Owner was GitHub Copilot (VS Code agent) at the user's request.
Bounded scope, as claimed: the T03 remaining frontier only. Files changed:
`crates/gpu-dialect-macros/src/validate.rs`, `crates/gpu-dialect-macros/src/regression_tests.rs`,
one `compile_fail` doctest in `crates/gpu-dialect/src/lib.rs`, a limits paragraph in
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and the `.ai/` records. No emitter, runtime, ABI, dependency,
or signing changes. Committed on top of `3fd0aac` in two scopes (below) and pushed
to `origin/main` at the user's request; unsigned like `3fd0aac` (no signing configured).

What changed (failing-first; all three new tests failed against `3fd0aac`):
- `visit_expr_cast`: `as` targets must be a single identifier in
  `f32`/`float`, `i32`/`int`, `u32`/`uint`. Previously `id.x as f64` translated to
  `f64(id.x)`, passed rustc (`uint` is a plain `u32` alias), and failed only in slangc.
- `visit_type_path`: Rust primitives outside the four-byte subset (`i8`..`i128`,
  `isize`, `u8`..`u128`, `usize`, `f16`, `f64`, `f128`, `char`, `str`) are rejected in
  every type position (let annotations, helper params/returns, struct fields, buffer
  element types). `let v: f64 = 1.0;` previously became `f64 v = 1.0;` — accepted by
  rustc and the macro, failing only at pipeline creation.
- `visit_expr_const`: inline `const { .. }` blocks are rejected by name. They were
  already stopped by the emitter's generic "not in the subset yet" fallback; the
  validator now owns the diagnostic, consistent with the other constructs.
- `bool` stays a supported type but is not a cast target (rustc rejects numeric→bool;
  bool→integer casts are unproven on the GPU).

Verification (Rust 1.98.0, Slang 2026.13.1, SPIRV-Tools v2026.3, RTX 5090/Vulkan):
`cargo fmt --all -- --check` exit 0; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -D warnings`
exit 0; `cargo test --workspace` **86 passed, 0 failed, 0 ignored** (81 unit/integration
+ 5 doctests; baseline 82). Both golden fixtures unchanged. `cargo run -p vector-add`
and `cargo run -p typed-pipeline` exit 0; no further derived-artifact drift.
Independent read-only review of this change: **PASS** — traversal reaches all type
positions, no escape to `emit_type`, no test passes for the wrong reason. Its design
note: the primitive rule is a denylist (exhaustive over Rust's finite primitive set),
but std-prelude type names such as `Option<uint>` still pass the validator and fail
only in slangc. That sibling gap is pre-existing and recorded in NEXT_TASKS T03.

Queue state found at pickup: the working tree was clean and the formerly pending
T06 slice 1 + quality patch is committed as `3fd0aac` ("T06 Continued", unsigned,
author = owner) and pushed to `origin/main`. The signing-key blocker recorded below
no longer gates that work; HEAD `3fd0aac`, 82 workspace tests passing at pickup.

Independent review of the quality patch (`d99d176..3fd0aac`, macro `slang.rs`,
`validate.rs`, core `slang.rs` diagnostics): **PASS**. A separate read-only reviewer
traced both `emit_struct_value` call sites (one per statement, fresh `enumerate`
per block), found no `Expr::Struct` reaching emission unrejected, and found no
diagnostic input that maps to a *wrong* kernel (only `None`). A hand-written Slang
unit re-declaring `__gust_struct_0` in nested blocks compiled on WGSL and SPIR-V
and passed `spirv-val`, so per-block temporary indices are valid Slang. One
low-severity note: nested struct literals (`Pair { a: Inner { .. } }`) are rejected
by the emitter, not the validator — correct behavior, pre-existing, not a regression.
The "do not label these patches independently approved" caveat below is now lifted.

`scripts/verify.ps1 -Full` re-run under pwsh 7.6.5 after `3fd0aac` (before this
validator change): **GUST verification passed**, 19 checks exit 0, five examples on
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, all eight SPIR-V exports validated. `.ai/VALIDATION.json`
refreshed. The run regenerated four stale derived exports (`particles__snapshot`,
`particles__step`, `polynomial__evaluate`, `signal_pipeline__transform` `.slang`):
each differs only by the T05 `// @rust kernel:` marker line; WGSL/SPIR-V unchanged.

Commits: `chore(artifacts): refresh VALIDATION.json and stale kernel-marker exports`
(VALIDATION.json + four `generated-wgpu/*.slang`) and `feat(validate): fail closed on
cast targets, non-32-bit primitives, and const blocks` (validate.rs,
regression_tests.rs, lib.rs doctest, ARCHITECTURE.md, .ai records).

Next command: claim one bounded task in this file before editing — either the
std-prelude type-name allowlist frontier (NEXT_TASKS T03) or T06 slice 2
(authoritative aggregate size/alignment/stride evidence via `scripts/probes/`).

## Checkpoint and T06 investigation (2026-09-07)

Owner: Codex at the user's request. Preserve the existing dirty checkpoint at
`d99d176`. Scope: full validation (VALIDATION.json and derived example exports),
independent review if available, bounded Slang layout probes under `target/`,
and durable investigation/status/roadmap notes. No runtime ABI expansion or new
dependencies. Signed commits still await the owner's existing public-key path.
Independent read-only checkpoint review: PASS, no blocking findings. Probe Builder
owns reproducible native Slang API sources under `scripts/probes/`; build outputs
remain under `target/t06-layout/`. This is investigation tooling, not a Rust runtime
dependency or broader supported GPU type contract.

## Quality review completed (2026-09-07)

Ownership released. Codex coordinated Scout/Builder work at the user's request. Baseline
is the existing uncommitted T06 slice on `main` at `d99d176`; 74 workspace tests
passed before this review. Preserve those edits. Bounded review scope: recent
T03/T04 macro changes and T05 compiler diagnostics; targeted regression-backed
fixes plus status/handoff/architecture corrections. No dependencies, ABI expansion,
signing changes, or commit in this review. Core diagnostics Builder owns
`crates/gpu-dialect/src/slang.rs`; Scout is read-only in macro sources.
Scout found struct self-assignment and dropped `..base` correctness gaps. Workers
then hit an allowance limit; Codex finished locally. Expanded bounded fix scope:
macro `slang.rs`, `validate.rs`, `regression_tests.rs`, numeric golden, and new
wgpu struct-assignment regression. Preserve all pre-existing T06 changes.

Findings fixed:
- T04 wrote struct fields into the destination while still reading the RHS. Real
  GPU regression failed: `(11, 101)` swapped to `(101, 101)`, not `(101, 11)`.
  Build a fresh reserved-name temporary in source field order, then assign once.
  This also preserves outer-variable reads in shadowing initializers. Reviewed
  numeric golden changed only to temporary construction and whole-value assignment.
- T04 accepted `Pair { first: 9, ..old }` but silently omitted copied fields.
  Failing-first validator regression now rejects record updates explicitly.
- T05 mapping missed actual Slang 2026.13.1 multiline `error[E...]` / arrow locations,
  accepted lookalike filenames, and could attribute a warning instead of an error.
  Legacy and current format tests plus actual failing compilation on both targets
  now cover correct kernel mapping and invalid/unrelated locations.

Verification: baseline 74 tests; final `cargo test --workspace` **82 passed,
0 failed, 0 ignored** (78 unit/integration + 4 doctests). Formatting check and
strict workspace/all-target Clippy exit 0. New struct-assignment tests compile
WGSL/SPIR-V and execute WGSL on NVIDIA RTX 5090/Vulkan at 1/63/64/65/257 elements.
`cargo run -p vector-add` and `cargo run -p typed-pipeline` exit 0; derived exports
unchanged. No full `verify.ps1 -Full` rerun; existing VALIDATION.json is historical.

Review limitation: Scout identified the frontend bugs and Builder contributed
diagnostic regressions, but worker allowance failures prevented an independent
review of the final patches. Codex performed final diff review and deterministic
checks; do not label these patches independently approved. No commit or signing
configuration change. Next step: independent review of this quality delta, then
resolve the existing signing-key-path blocker before the pending commits.

Updated: 2026-09-07. T06 slice 1 implementation ownership released after verification.
Files: core `reflect.rs`, `lib.rs`, reflection tests, and T06 status/architecture/
decision/handoff notes. Delegated Builder and independent Verifier are finished;
Codex integrated and ran workspace checks. Signed commit is pending the owner's
existing signing public-key path. No local model endpoints were contacted.
Prior completed work owner: Kilo (co-maintainer); Codex
may collaborate for continuity. Completed scope: documentation, translator
stability/tests, runtime cache/compiler bridge, validation tooling (incl. verify.ps1
stderr capture), T04 (numeric semantics + field-aware struct construction), T05
(capability probe records + kernel-level Slang→Rust diagnostic mapping), and the T03
second slice (broader name resolution + effect analysis at unsupported frontend
boundaries). P1 is complete except T06. The owner has now **lifted the T06 deferral**
(2026-09-07); T06 slice 1 adds compiler JSON inspection and partial layout checks.
This continuation implements that bounded slice; no wider ABI expansion.

## This pass (T06 slice 1 — compiler-authoritative layout reflection)

T06 was deferred; the owner authorized this bounded first slice. Added
`crates/gpu-dialect/src/reflect.rs`: dependency-free strict JSON parser,
`Reflection::from_json`, target-specific `reflect`, recursive field/resource records,
and `cross_check_pod::<T>`. Added the public module/re-exports in `lib.rs` and
`crates/gpu-dialect/tests/reflection.rs`. The existing public `TemporaryDirectory`
from baseline commit `d99d176` is reused; no changes to `slang.rs` or dependencies.

Actual Slang 2026.13.1 WGSL and SPIR-V JSON reports field offsets/sizes and resource
binding indices/access, but omits aggregate size, alignment, and storage-buffer
element stride. These remain `None`/unverified in `PodCrossCheck`; `Ok` does not
mean complete ABI proof. A field's `elementStride: 0` is not buffer stride.
Macro descriptors, wgpu uploads, and the four-byte storage ABI remain unchanged.
The wider T06 milestone is not complete.

Baseline: clean `main` at `d99d176`; `cargo test --workspace` 68 passed. Tools:
Rust 1.98.0 (88d9e12ae), Slang 2026.13.1-1-g84792eb15; GPU NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090.
New API test failed first with expected unresolved imports. Existing vector-add
and typed-pipeline programs both exit 0 on RTX 5090 after integration; generated
artifacts unchanged.

Final verification (2026-09-07): `cargo fmt --all -- --check` exit 0;
`cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` exit 0;
`cargo test --workspace` **74 passed, 0 failed, 0 ignored** (70 unit/integration,
4 doctests). New evidence: strict JSON grammar/Unicode/depth tests; actual nested
WGSL/SPIR-V reflection; negative offset/size/name/count/scalar/stride comparisons;
binding space/access; compiler failures; failing-first rejection of unsupported
entry-point resource parameters. Independent Verifier: **PASS**, including a
separate run of all 5 reflection integration tests. No full `verify.ps1 -Full`
run this slice; `.ai/VALIDATION.json` remains the prior full-run record.

Commit blocker: the owner chose signing setup before commit, then chose an existing
key but has not supplied its `.pub` path. No signing configuration was changed and
no unsigned commit was made. HEAD remains `d99d176483a0c9bb9be42ae7f31879eb5238f54c`;
all task edits are uncommitted. Next step: obtain the signing public-key path,
configure repository-local SSH signing, verify signer availability, then commit
the scoped files with `feat(reflect): add Slang JSON reflection and POD cross-checks`.

## This pass (T03 second slice — name resolution + effect analysis)

Fail-closed the gap between what the validator accepted and what the translator can
lower. Two classes of diagnostic added in `crates/gpu-dialect-macros/src/validate.rs`:

- **Name resolution.** A bare path *value* must be a single identifier (a local or
  parameter). Multi-segment paths are associated constants or foreign items (`f32::
  INFINITY`, `u32::MAX`, `core::f32::consts::PI`) that the translator would emit as
  invalid Slang (`f32.INFINITY`). New `visit_expr_path` rejects them; callee paths are
  unaffected because `visit_expr_call` only descends for single-identifier helpers.
  `core` added to `BANNED_NAMES` so `core::` in path *types* is also rejected.
- **Effect analysis.** New `visit_expr_try` rejects the `?` operator and
  `visit_expr_unsafe` rejects `unsafe` blocks — both previously accepted by the
  validator and only caught later by the translator's generic "not in the subset"
  error. `asm!` needs no new rule: syn 2.0 parses it as `Expr::Macro`, already
  rejected by the existing macro rule.

Failing-first tests added in `regression_tests.rs`: `unsupported_name_paths_are_rejected`
(4 cases) and `unsupported_effects_are_rejected` (3 cases). Verified 2026-09-07:
`cargo fmt --check` clean; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
clean; `cargo test --workspace` **68 passed, 0 failed** (66 prior + 2 new, incl. 5
example binaries on RTX 5090 + 4 compile-fail doc tests); `cargo run -p vector-add`
and `cargo run -p typed-pipeline` both exit 0 on the RTX 5090. Known remaining
frontier (not claimed here): cast target types and `const` blocks are still accepted
by the validator and only fail at Slang compile time.

## This pass (both items complete)

- Bounded tooling fix: `scripts/verify.ps1` `Invoke-Checked` now captures **both**
  stdout and stderr (via temp files) and records them in `VALIDATION.json` as `stdout`
  and a new `stderr` field. Exit-code/throw behavior is unchanged. Why: a failing
  command's diagnostic (cargo/clippy emit on stderr) was previously absent from the
  JSON record, leaving only the generic `"... failed (exit N)"` message. File scope:
  `scripts/verify.ps1` only; no Rust/ABI/translator changes.
  - **Verified end-to-end (2026-09-07, PowerShell 7.6.5):** full `-Full` run passed
    (`VALIDATION.json` `passed: true`, 19 checks exit 0). `slangc -version` now lands
    in `stderr` (record line 33); `cargo clippy`/`cargo test` runner lines captured in
    `stderr` (lines 59, 69); the `µs` timings render correctly (UTF-8 fix confirmed —
    no more `┬╡`). 57 tests, all 5 examples on RTX 5090, 8 SPIR-V artifacts validated.
  - **Environment note:** run the script under **PowerShell 7** (`pwsh`, 7.6.5), not
    Windows PowerShell 5.1. `pwsh` is on PATH; `$PSHOME` confirms 7.6.5.
- **T05 (P1) complete — both slices.** Slice 1: `TargetProbe` record + `probe` in
  `crates/gpu-dialect/src/slang.rs` compiles a known-good minimal kernel to a target
  and records `supported`/`detail` (failing-first tests, WGSL + SPIR-V);
  PORTABLE_SLANG_CORE.md documents the record format. Slice 2: `emit_kernel` writes a
  `// @rust kernel: {module}::{kernel}` marker per kernel; on `slangc` failure the
  bridge parses the reported line and appends the nearest marker's kernel to the
  `CompilationFailed` diagnostic (kernel-level mapping; stable-Rust `proc_macro`
  spans do not expose line numbers). Goldens updated; two mapping tests added.
   Evidence (2026-09-07): core 12 passed, macros 20 passed, wgpu semantics 2 passed
   (RTX 5090). Full `cargo test --workspace` re-run after the slice 2 commit:
   **66 passed, 0 failed** (62 unit/integration incl. 5 example binaries on RTX 5090,
   + 4 compile-fail doc tests). A full `verify.ps1 -Full` (fmt/clippy/examples/SPIR-V)
   re-run after the slice 2 commit was not completed; the last full pass in
   VALIDATION.json (2026-09-07 13:54 UTC) predates the slice 2 commit.

## Verified baseline

- Checkout: `C:\Users\micro\Desktop\gpu-dialect-v0`. Git repository exists
  (owner-initialized 2026-09-07; branch `main`, 9 commits as of this update; working
  tree clean, `.agents/skills/` fully tracked). A Kilo worktree
  (`.kilo/worktrees/enchanted-farmhouse`) sits on the same commit.
- 34 workspace tests passed before code changes, including actual GPU tests.
- Rust 1.98.0; Slang 2026.13.1-1-g84792eb15; SPIRV-Tools installed.
- Source/artifact hashes before edits: `BASELINE.sha256` (not a content backup).

## Implemented and verified during this pass

- GUST documentation retains the working GPU Dialect subsystem and records future
  semantic frontend, execution graph, portability tiers, and ECS destination.
- Tail helper returns, numeric literal lowering, binary grouping, and boolean/integer
  negation; unsafe positional struct literals now fail explicitly.
- Reviewed complete Slang golden, diagnostic unit tests, real-GPU semantics fixture.
- Explicit typed locals and fail-closed signature/attribute/builtin diagnostics.
- Entrypoint-aware cache identity, proven with two entrypoints sharing one source
  and different GPU results; owned temporary directories, cleanup failure tests,
  compiler diagnostic capture and SPIR-V structure validation.
- Final full script: formatting and strict Clippy passed; **57 tests passed**
  (53 unit/integration + 4 compile-fail documentation tests), zero failed/ignored.
- All five examples ran on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 via native Vulkan wgpu; all
  eight exported SPIR-V kernels passed `spirv-val --target-env vulkan1.2`.
- All eight artifact sets regenerated. `VALIDATION.json` records 19 successful
  commands and 8 validated SPIR-V hashes. Its scope is local debug verification,
  not release benchmarking or browser/Metal/DXIL certification.
- Deliberate missing-tool test confirmed the verification script records failure
  and stops; the final successful full run replaced that failure report.
- T04 (this pass): numeric semantics proven on a real GPU (signed/unsigned div/mod,
  float→int casts, overflow wrap) against an independent host reference; integer
  div/rem by a literal zero diagnosed at the Rust boundary; field-aware struct
  construction lowered to construct-then-assign (field identity + source order),
  supported as a `let` initializer and assignment RHS and rejected elsewhere. New
  `numeric` fixture (golden + GPU test) and macro regression tests.
- T05 (this pass): capability probe records (`TargetProbe` + `probe`, failing-first
  WGSL/SPIR-V tests, PORTABLE_SLANG_CORE.md record format) and kernel-level
  Slang→Rust diagnostic mapping (`// @rust kernel:` markers + nearest-marker lookup
  appended to `CompilationFailed`); goldens updated, two mapping tests.
- T03 second slice (this pass): fail-closed name resolution and effect analysis —
  `visit_expr_path` rejects multi-segment bare path values (associated constants /
  foreign items like `f32::INFINITY`, `u32::MAX`), `core` added to `BANNED_NAMES`,
  `visit_expr_try` rejects `?`, `visit_expr_unsafe` rejects `unsafe` blocks. Two
  failing-first regression tests (7 cases total). 68 tests pass, fmt/clippy clean,
  both examples run on RTX 5090.
- `scripts/verify.ps1`: `Invoke-Checked` captures stderr in addition to stdout and
  records both in `VALIDATION.json` (`stdout` + new `stderr` field). Failure records
  now carry the actual compiler/test diagnostic, not just the exit code. Behavior
  (stop on first failure, always write the JSON record) is unchanged.

## Current executable scope

Direct syn → Slang; Rust private shadow checking; WGSL → Vulkan wgpu; SPIR-V export.
Five runnable examples; scalar/nested padding-free typed storage; shader/layout/
pipeline cache; persistent buffers; dependent batches; async jobs; optional timestamps.
Bindings/layouts are manual macro metadata, not Slang reflection.

No rustc semantic frontend, graph compiler, ECS, renderer, indirect dispatch, dynamic
capacity growth, browser validation, or DXIL/Metal execution. Reflection is deferred.
Known correctness debt: implicit inference versus Rust-resolved types, evaluation
order/alias analysis, full name hygiene, and line-level Slang-to-Rust source maps
(kernel-level mapping exists; line-level needs non-stable spans). Numeric edge
semantics and field-aware struct construction are proven in bounded contexts (T04).
Resource helper parameters, shader struct literals, multi-segment path values
(associated constants / foreign items), the `?` operator, and `unsafe` blocks are
explicitly rejected. Cast target types and `const` blocks are still accepted by the
validator and only fail at Slang compile time. Concurrent cache misses may duplicate
compilation. See `NEXT_TASKS.md` for bounded follow-up.

## Allowance and handoff

The owner requested stopping new work near 10% remaining in either allowance window.
Reliable starting readings were 88% five-hour / 29% weekly. No reset credit is
authorized. Final handoff readings are recorded in `HANDOFF.md`; never infer live
account state from this historical note.
