//! Backend-neutral typed dispatch surface (roadmap M2, slice m2.a).
//!
//! A `#[gpu]` kernel handle (a [`Kernel`]) gets generated `call`, `submit` and `dispatch` functions, except a kernel
//! with a `Uniform<T>`/`ConstantBuffer<T>` parameter, which gets none of the three; `call` turns
//! typed buffer references into a [`Call`]: the kernel, the element count and one erased [`TypedDevice::Binding`] per
//! storage parameter. This module holds only what that generated code and the backends share:
//!
//! - [`TypedDevice`]: extension of [`Device`] that names the erased, `Copy` binding of one device. [`Device`] itself is
//!   unchanged, so existing backends compile as before.
//! - [`Run<K, N>`]: the executable hook. A device runs kernel `K` (with `N` storage parameters) when it implements
//!   `Run<K, N>`. A GPU backend implements it once for every `K` (a blanket impl); a CPU backend implements it per
//!   kernel, next to the body it executes. `K: Kernel` exposes only a descriptor, so generic code cannot reach a body
//!   through `K` itself.
//! - [`Resource`]: a typed buffer of one device. Through a *generated* `call`, its `Element` and `Device` associated
//!   types make a buffer of the wrong element type, or of another device *type*, a compile error. `Call::new` and
//!   `Resource::bind` are public, so hand-built calls are not covered by that check; see the contract below.
//! - [`Arg`], [`Independent`], [`LengthRule`]: one argument of a call and the call-site opt-in that lets a
//!   buffer's length differ from the element count.
//! - [`Call`]: a plain, reusable value: what the generated `call` returns, what [`Run::submit_call`] consumes and what
//!   the staged graph (m2.e) records. Its descriptor is taken from `K` and its parameter count from `N`; it cannot be
//!   built from a free-form descriptor.
//!
//! # Contract for every backend
//!
//! - **The backend checks every binding against `call.kernel()` at submit**, and does not trust the binding or the
//!   generated code: the binding's access equals the descriptor's access for that parameter, its element layout equals
//!   the parameter's layout, it belongs to this device *instance* (two devices of one type share a `Binding` type), and
//!   its length obeys the rule below, measured at submit and not when the call was built. A hand-built `Call` can have
//!   the right count and still the wrong order, access, element or device.
//! - One buffer bound twice in one call is accepted when both bindings are [`Access::ReadOnly`]; when either side is
//!   [`Access::ReadWrite`] the backend rejects the call at run time with an error that names both parameters, before
//!   it writes anything (S0 decision A; `gust-wgpu` implements this in m2.c).
//! - `LengthRule::Shared` bindings must hold exactly `element_count` elements; `LengthRule::Independent` ones only
//!   need to be non-empty when `element_count` is non-zero (the rules of the existing runtime checks).
//!
//! # What the tests in this file are
//!
//! The `tests` module holds two mock devices written only to exercise this surface. The recording mock mirrors a GPU
//! backend: one blanket `Run` impl, it records the call and never runs a kernel body (D21/D22). The CPU-shaped mock
//! proves the surface is executable in safe Rust (the module forbids `unsafe`; `RefCell` borrows only) by running
//! *hand-written test bodies* through the same `Call`, and it implements the backend contract above; it is test-only,
//! defines no CPU execution contract for `#[gpu]` shadow bodies and is not a backend. The M3 CPU backend is a
//! separate design (it will need a backend-neutral way to read a binding's identity and access, which this module
//! deliberately does not add yet).
