# Compiler testing

Choose the smallest test that can disprove the change, then expand only across affected compiler boundaries. Keep the locked toolchain and dependency versions.

1. Validator: accepted fixture plus single-cause rejection test with a meaningful diagnostic, in `crates/gust-macros/src/tests`. A `compile_fail` doctest in `crates/gust/src/lib.rs` covers source that rustc itself must still reject.
2. Emitter: source -> expected Slang semantics against the reviewed goldens in `tests/fixtures/`, then actual slangc compilation for supported targets.
3. Runtime: expected values from an independent host reference against GPU readback, including partial workgroups.
4. Run focused tests before workspace checks. Never regenerate expected diagnostics or goldens automatically to make a test pass.

Read [test layers](references/test-layers.md) for regression selection. Pick the check with `cargo xtask check-feature <area>` or `cargo xtask check-changed`; `cargo xtask check-format`, `cargo xtask check-lints` (Clippy, warnings denied) and `cargo xtask check-workspace` run locked formatting, lint and workspace tests. They report cargo checks only; they do not certify a GPU run or that every intended fixture exists. Evidence tiers are defined in `docs/development/VALIDATION.md`.
