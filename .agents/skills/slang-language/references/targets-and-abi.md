# Slang target and ABI notes

Use the repository's pinned slangc first; record `slangc -version`. This bundle's scripts specify `-entry`, `-stage compute`, `-target` and `-o` explicitly. Extra profile/capability/include arguments are caller supplied, not guessed. Compile WGSL and SPIR-V separately to expose target restrictions.

Project design guidance:
- Use an explicit `(set, binding, access, element layout)` contract shared by emitter and runtime. Slang `[[vk::binding(binding, set)]]` uses binding first; wgpu uses group=set.
- Keep module resources and helper names deterministic. Do not trust compiler auto-allocation to match independently handwritten host layouts.
- A compute entry uses `[shader("compute")]`, `[numthreads(x,y,z)]` and `uint3 ... : SV_DispatchThreadID`. Dispatch counts are workgroups, not invocations.
- Resource types such as `StructuredBuffer<float>` and `RWStructuredBuffer<float>` have different access requirements. Do not translate Rust references into arbitrary shader pointers.
- For portability start with scalar 32-bit storage elements. Rust struct layout alone is not proof of shader layout; verify offsets, alignment, stride and padding. Avoid host bool storage and vec3 packing assumptions.
- The bundled shader uses four storage bindings and a one-u32 length buffer for a simple explicit ABI. It is a toolchain fixture, not a mandated project ABI.
- Keep a bounds check around reads and writes when dispatch rounds up. Validate all input lengths on the host; checking only output length is insufficient.

WGSL has target-specific restrictions and binding behavior. Check the feature in the pinned Slang version and test the generated WGSL through wgpu validation. Do not work around errors by silently switching targets.
